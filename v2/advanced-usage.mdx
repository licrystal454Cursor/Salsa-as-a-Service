### Configuring Advanced Forecasting

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Select Forecast Horizon">
    Choose your forecasting window based on your operational needs:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="7 Days">
        **Short-term** planning for daily production and staffing.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="14 Days">
        **Medium-term** planning for ingredient ordering and labor.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="30+ Days">
        **Long-term** planning for seasonality and strategic prep.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Data Sources">
    Connect additional data sources to improve accuracy:

    ```javascript
    const forecastConfig = {
      data_sources: {
        pos_sales: true,
        reservations: true,
        weather_api: "openweathermap",
        events: ["eventbrite", "local_calendar"],
        foot_traffic: "sensor_data",
        social_media: ["yelp", "google_reviews"]
      },
      model_parameters: {
        confidence_level: 0.95,
        seasonality: "auto_detect",
        trend_sensitivity: "medium",
        anomaly_detection: true
      }
    };
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Alert Thresholds">
    Configure alerts for significant forecast changes or anomalies.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Auto-Actions">
    Let AI automatically adjust production schedules based on forecasts.
  </Step>
</Steps>



### Interpreting Forecast Results

The AI provides rich forecast data with confidence intervals:

```json
{
  "forecast_date": "2024-01-20",
  "predicted_demand": {
    "house_salsa": {
      "quantity": 12.5,
      "unit": "gallons",
      "confidence_interval": [11.2, 13.8],
      "confidence_level": 0.95
    }
  },
  "factors": {
    "historical_trend": "+15%",
    "day_of_week": "Friday (+20%)",
    "weather": "Sunny, 72°F (+5%)",
    "local_events": ["Concert at venue 0.5mi away (+10%)"],
    "seasonality": "Winter season (-5%)"
  },
  "recommendation": {
    "action": "increase_production",
    "suggested_batches": 3,
    "timing": "Start production by 9:00 AM"
  }
}
```

### Forecast Accuracy Tracking

Monitor and improve your forecast accuracy over time:


#### Accuracy Metrics

- **MAPE**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error
- **Forecast Bias**: Systematic over/under prediction
- **Confidence Intervals**: Actual vs predicted ranges

#### Model Performance

View which models perform best for different scenarios:

- Short-term vs long-term accuracy
- Recipe-specific performance
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Event impact prediction

#### Continuous Learning

The AI automatically:

- Retrains models weekly with new data
- Adjusts weights based on accuracy
- Identifies and adapts to new patterns
- A/B tests model improvements



## IoT Sensor Integration

### Sensor Types and Capabilities




### Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

Access comprehensive sensor data in real-time:

<Note>
  **Dashboard Features**: Live sensor feeds, historical trends, anomaly alerts, predictive maintenance warnings, and automated reports.
</Note>


```python
# Example: Query sensor data via API
from salsa_sdk import SalsaClient

client = SalsaClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Get real-time sensor readings
sensors = client.iot.get_sensors(location="kitchen_1")
for sensor in sensors:
    reading = sensor.get_latest_reading()
    print(f"{sensor.name}: {reading.value} {reading.unit}")

    if reading.is_anomaly():
        print(f"⚠️  Alert: {reading.anomaly_details}")

# Query historical data
history = client.iot.query_history(
    sensor_id="temp_sensor_001",
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-31",
    aggregation="hourly"
)
```

### Predictive Maintenance

AI analyzes sensor patterns to predict equipment failures before they occur:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Equipment Profiling">
    System learns normal operating parameters for each piece of equipment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Anomaly Detection">
    ML models detect subtle changes that indicate potential issues:

    - Temperature fluctuations
    - Unusual vibration patterns
    - Performance degradation
    - Power consumption changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Failure Prediction">
    Predicts equipment failures 3-14 days in advance with 85% accuracy.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automated Alerts">
    Notifies maintenance team with specific recommended actions.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Advanced Automation

### Automated Reordering

Let AI manage your ingredient inventory automatically:


#### Configuration

```javascript
    const autoOrderConfig = {
      enabled: true,
      suppliers: ["sysco", "us_foods"],
      rules: {
        reorder_trigger: "forecast_based",  // or "threshold_based"
        lead_time_buffer: 2,  // days
        safety_stock_level: 1.5,  // multiplier
        max_order_frequency: "daily",
        budget_constraints: {
          monthly_max: 50000,
          per_order_max: 5000
        }
      },
      approval_workflow: {
        auto_approve_under: 1000,
        require_approval_over: 1000,
        approvers: ["manager@restaurant.com"]
      }
    };
    ```

#### Order Logic

The AI considers multiple factors:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Demand Forecast">
    Predicted usage for the next 7-30 days.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Current Inventory">
    Real-time stock levels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Supplier Lead Times">
    Historical delivery times.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cost Optimization">
    Best pricing and minimum order quantities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seasonality">

### API & Integration Platform

Build custom solutions with our enterprise API:


#### GraphQL and REST API

Use GraphQL for flexible queries and REST for quick integrations:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GraphQL">
    ```graphql
    query GetProductionForecast {
      forecast(location: "loc_123", days: 7) {
        date
        recipes {
          id
          name
          predictedDemand {
            quantity
            unit
            confidence
          }
        }
      }
    }

    subscription OnQualityAlert {
      qualityAlert(location: "loc_123") {
        id
        severity
        sensorId
        message
        timestamp
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="REST">
    ```bash
    # Get forecast
    curl -X GET https://api.salsaasaservice.com/v2/forecast \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"

    # Create production batch
    curl -X POST https://api.salsaasaservice.com/v2/production/batches \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{"recipe_id": "rec_456", "quantity": 5.0}'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  "data": {
    "alert_id": "alert_789",
    "location_id": "loc_123",
    "severity": "high",
    "message": "Temperature out of range",
    "sensor_id": "temp_001",
    "reading": {
      "value": 45.3,
      "threshold": 40.0
    }
  },
  "signature": "sha256=abc123..."
}
```



## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization

Optimize API queries for large-scale operations:

```graphql
# Use field-level caching
query GetLocations @cache(ttl: 300) {
  locations {
    id
    name
    # Only request fields you need
    currentInventory {
      ingredientId
      quantity
    }
  }
}

# Use pagination for large datasets
query GetProductionHistory(
  $first: Int = 50,
  $after: String
) {
  productionBatches(first: $first, after: $after) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        recipeId
        quantity
      }
      cursor
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategies

Implement caching for optimal performance:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="CDN Caching">
    Static resources cached at edge locations for fast global access.
  </Step>

  <Step title="API Response Caching">
    Frequently accessed data cached with configurable TTL.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Client-Side Caching">
    Use our SDK's built-in caching for repeated queries.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cache Invalidation">
    Automatic cache invalidation on data updates.
  </Step>
</Steps>
