# Changed Components

## Summary

1. Enhanced v2 MDX files with improved component usage.
2. Added a brief explanation of component choices:
   - Why specific components were chosen for specific content.
   - How the enhancements improve user experience.
   - Any custom styling decisions and their rationale.

## File Updates

### File 1: `changelog.mdx`

- Structured release history using reusable `<Update>` blocks:
  - Monthly entries from **September 2023** through **March 2024**.
  - Each update includes `label`, `description` (version), `tags`, and `rss` summary text.

### File 2: `Integrations.mdx`

- Updated redirects to point to the correct headers.
- Added cards at the top and bottom.
- Added tabs.
- Added steps.
- Added an accordion section at the bottom.

## Component Details

### 1. Cards (Top and Bottom)

- **Top section: Integration Categories**
  - Uses a 3-column layout with 6 cards:
    - Point of Sale
    - Supply Chain
    - Kitchen Management
    - Enterprise Systems
    - Communication
    - IoT & Hardware
  - Each card links to a corresponding section via `href` anchors, so users can jump directly to relevant content.

- **Bottom section: Integration Support**
  - Uses a 2-column layout with 2 cards:
    - Documentation
    - Developer Portal
  - Provides clear CTAs and links to API reference and developer portal resources.

### 2. Tabs (`borderBottom` style)

Several long integration lists were converted into tabs so users can view one option at a time:

- **Popular POS Integrations**
  - Square
  - Toast
  - Lightspeed
  - TouchBistro
  - Revel
  - Clover
- **Supply Chain & Distributors**
  - Sysco
  - US Foods
  - Performance Food Group
  - Gordon Food Service
  - Local Suppliers
- **Enterprise Systems (ERP)**
  - SAP
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft Dynamics
- **Team Communication**
  - Slack
  - Microsoft Teams
  - SMS & Voice
- **IoT & Hardware (Certified Hardware Partners)**
  - Temperature Sensors
  - Digital Scales
  - Smart Thermometers
- **Business Intelligence & Analytics**
  - Tableau
  - Power BI
  - Looker

`borderBottom` was added to each `<Tabs>` component so the content area has a bottom border and padding. For the BI section, tab content containing markdown lists was wrapped in a `<div>` to ensure MDX parses it correctly.

### 3. Steps

Under **Custom Integrations -> Integration Development**, a numbered list was replaced with a `Steps` component:

1. Review Documentation
2. Get API Credentials
3. Use SDKs
4. Test in Sandbox
5. Deploy to Production

This makes the integration flow clearly sequential and easier to follow.

### 4. AccordionGroup

- **Support Channels** and **Request New Integrations** were converted into an `AccordionGroup` with two accordion items.
- Users can expand only the section they need, keeping the page shorter and more focused.

## Why These Components Were Chosen

- **Cards**: Act as a visual table of contents at the top and highlight next actions at the bottom.
- **Tabs**: Improve scanability for long lists of similar integration options.
- **Steps**: Match the fixed, sequential integration-development workflow.
- **Accordions**: Keep secondary support/reference content compact and optional.

## UX Improvements

- A consistent release structure that let users quickly compare versions and find 
  relevant changes in the changeLogs
- Faster navigation through top-level category cards.
- Clear next actions through support cards at the bottom.
- Less scrolling and reduced visual clutter via tabs.
- Better process clarity with a sequential `Steps` flow.
- Cleaner page structure by collapsing secondary information into accordions.
